\paragraph{Telco Dataset}
The Telco Customer Churn Dataset we'll be using throughout this paper contains information about the customers from an unidentified telecommunications company. The data was uploaded to kaggle.com by a user named blastchar. \cite{blastchar_2018} The dataset originates from a sample dataset provided by IBM for exploring the capabilities of IBM's Watson Analytics services. IBM uses the data in a walkthrough of building a model for predicting whether a customer will leave the company, with the explicit goal of creating better customer retention programs. \cite{ibm_telco_2015} There are a number of sample data sets provided by IBM for similar walkthroughs related to their Watson Analytics system. \cite{ibm_data_2015} We were unable to determine conclusively if the Telco Dataset we're interested in for this paper was based on data from a real telecommunications company, or if the data was synthetically generated for the purposes of demostrating the watson analytics system's capabilities.

\section{Research Question, Hypotheses and Methods (variable explanations)}
\paragraph{Research Question}
Are there significant relationships with the following variables and Churn:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Contract Type}
\item{Paperless Billing}
\item{Parner}
\item{Device Protection}
\item{Tech Support}
\item{Online Backup}
\end{itemize}
Original Research Question:
Is Churn rate independent of the type of contract a customer holds and if the average tenure of customers who churned is different that the average tenure of customers who are remaining with the company.
