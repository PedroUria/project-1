Identifying Customer Churn in a Telecom Company Using Big Data Techniques}, journal={Journal of Information Systems Education}, volume={27}, number={4}, pages={223-232}, note={Copyright - Copyright EDSIG Fall 2016; Last updated - 2018-05-23},abstract={Within the context of the telecom industry, this teaching case is an active learning analytics exercise to help students build hands-on expertise on how to utilize Big Data to solve a business problem. Particularly, the case utilizes an analytics method to help develop a customer retention strategy to mitigate against an increasing customer churn problem in a telecom company. Traditionally, the forecast of customer churn uses various demographic and cell phone usage data. Big Data techniques permit a much finer granularity in the prediction of churn by analyzing specific activities a customer undertakes before churning. The authors help students to understand how data from customer interactions with the company through multiple channels can be combined to create a "session." Subsequently, the authors demonstrate the use of effective visualization to identify the most relevant paths to customer churn. The Teradata Aster Big Data platform is used in developing this case study.}, keywords={Education--Computer Applications; MIS; Teaching; Data management; Chief executive officers; Big Data; Active learning; Telecommunications industry; Demographics; Curricula; Neural networks; Customer retention; Telecommunications; Data analysis; Business schools; Service industries; Customer services; Students}, isbn={10553096}, language={English}, url={http://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1939895695?accountid=11243}}
