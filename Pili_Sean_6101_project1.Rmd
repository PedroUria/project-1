# Plan

##First 

* $\chi^2$ test for each variable to get the relevant ones.
* New variables with combination/permutations for the `InternetService`, `StreamingTv`, `StreamingMovies`

```{r data prep}
unique(chrn$StreamingTV)
chrn$StreamingTV <- gsub("No internet service", 0, chrn$StreamingTV)
unique(chrn$StreamingTV)
```

```{r}
for(c in chrn$SeniorCitizen){
  
}
```

# Are singles more likely to churn? looks that way...., or at least... most ppl with partners DIDN'T churn
# might need to just look at percentages here, because there are just MORE PEOPLe WHO didn't churn.... so it's more of a p(churn|factor)
x11()

# let' s do this for the rest of the character varaibles.

chrn_no = chrn[chrn$Churn=="No",]
hist(chrn_yes$tenure)
hist(chrn_no$tenure)
# the means are definitely different here..... 
#let's try 2 histograms??? 
# ANOVA time? logistic regression. 


# the "yes" histogram was what we expected, the no, not quite. 
# it seems people who have been there a while are the ones who end it 
# could it be that they're just dying of old age? lol... check how many are senior citizens...
